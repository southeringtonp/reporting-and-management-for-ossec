Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------

This package contains parsing logic, saved searches, and
dashboards for monitoring the OSSEC Host-based Intrusion
Detection System via Splunk.

Please read the Installation section below - the app
WILL NOT WORK without configuration.

This app is maintained by Paul Southerington.



Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------

To install, extract the .tgz archive in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps

You will need to enable the appropriate inputs, either via
inputs.conf, or through the Manager in the Splunk GUI.

If you wish to monitor agent status, you may need to modify
the settings in bin/ossec_status.sh.  See that file, as well
as the description below.

The application maintains a list of all known OSSEC servers
in a lookup table. When you first install, this list will
be empty. You can wait until it is populated automatically,
or run the [OSSEC - Rebuild OSSEC Server Lookup Table] saved
search to regenerate it automatically.



Data Inputs
-----------------------------------------------------------

Sample input declarations are included with the application,
but are disabled by default. These may be enabled either
in inputs.conf, or via the Manager.

Several data input methods are available:
   
   1) Native syslog daemon, writing to flat files which
      are indexed by Splunk

   2) Syslog-style input directly to Splunk, listening
      on a UDP port (this is the method often used by the
      Splunk for OSSEC 3.x application)

   3) Direct monitoring of OSSEC alert logs. Typically
      requires Splunk to be installed on the OSSEC server.

   4) Scripted input to periodically check the status of
      OSSEC agents by running ossec_agent_control -l,
      either locally or on a remote system.

For options (1) and (2), set the sourcetype to 'ossec'.
For option (3), set the sourcetype to 'ossec_alerts'.
For option (4), set the sourcetype to 'ossec_agent_control'.






Remote Collection of OSSEC agent operational status:
-----------------------------------------------------------

To enable remote collection of OSSEC agent status, you will
need to do the following:

    1) Create a unix user account for splunk on the OSSEC server.

    2) Create an ssh keypair allowing the Splunk server to log in
       without a password.

    3) Place the ssh private key on the Splunk server in a secure
       location.

    4) Set privileges to allow the user access to OSSEC, or
       add the following line to /etc/sudoers:
            splunk	ALL = NOPASSWD: /var/ossec/bin/agent_control -l

	Don't forget that sudoers is picky about whitespace.

    5) On the splunk server, edit the scripted input, setting the
       appropriate values for $SSH_KEY_FILE, $OSSEC_SERVER, and $OSSEC_USER
       The file to edit should be at:
               $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/bin/ossec_status.sh

    6) Run the script once manually to test. This will also give you the
       chance to accept the server's private key. You will need to do this
       under the account that the Splunk server is using.

    7) Enable the scripted input in Splunk (web gui or inputs.conf)



Field Mappings
-------------------------------------

These need work, and may be subject to change. Ultimately,
we need to conform to the Splunk Common Information Model.

OSSEC           Splunk
--------        ------------
Level           Severity
User            User
Src IP          reporting_ip or src_ip
Rule            rule_number
Category        ossec_group
Server		ossec_server or host
