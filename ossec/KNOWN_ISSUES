Supported Splunk Versions:

  - Splunk 4.1 is now required. 4.1.4 or higher is highly recommended.

  - Agent management is new and has several limitations, including:
      - Does not run on Windows due to the limitations of pexpect


Limitations from Splunk Free Version:

  - The free version of Splunk does not supply scheduled searches,
    so the lookup table containing the list of OSSEC servers will
    not be automatically generated. To generate the list manually,
    run the 'OSSEC - Rebuild OSSEC Server Lookup Table' saved
    search after installing.

  - Scheduled searches for summary indexing require a
    Splunk Enterprise License.


User Interface Issues:

  - The File Integrity dashboard populates the dropdown list of
    reporting hosts based on those seen in the last day. Low-activity
    servers may not appear in the list.

  - By default, UI elements are scoped globally and may appear in
    menus for other apps. This is by design, as the app was originally
    written as a plugin to search, but will likely change in the future.

  - Machine counts across the top of the Agent Coverage view
    may be difficult to read, depending on the background color.


Input issues:

  - Remote monitoring of agent status may need sudo to work correctly.
    TBD - Identify whether this can be made to work without elevated
    privileges. These connections may also trigger OSSEC alerts.

  - Assigning the 'host' field to contain the 'ossec_server' value
    does not work when directly indexing the alerts.log file, because
    alerts in this file do not record the name of the OSSEC server.



Agent Management Issues:

  - Agent management has only limited concurrency protection. While
    Splunk will not connect to the manage_agents command with more
    than one search at a time, there is no guarantee that other
    processes are not using the underlying agents file.

  - Agent management commands cannot be configured through the GUI.
    This is by design, to reduce the risk of system compromise by
    arbitrary commands being run by the Splunk server as root.
