Parsing / Transform Issues:

  - The 'host' field in Splunk contains the name or IP address of the 
    OSSEC server. The host on which the event occurred is parsed into
    'reporting_host'. This is by design, but we may wish to continue
    overriding the value of 'host'. This needs further thought, since
    in Splunk 'host' is an indexed field and 'reporting_host' is not.
    The 'ossec_server' field should always contain the server's
    name, even if we decide to remap the 'host' field.


Dashboard Issues:

  - Field layout on the Event Search is messy.

  - The File Integrity dashboard populated the dropdown list of
    reporting hosts based on those seen in the last day. Low-activity
    servers may not appear in the list.

  - Sometimes the main Dashboard doesn't properly populate the host
    selection for all graphs. Changing to a different server and back
    or refreshing the page may resolve this in the short term. This
    appears to be a Splunk issue rather than a problem with the
    dashboard itself.


Input issues:

  - When using scripted inputs to monitor a remote OSSEC server, the
    'host' field will always show the local server name. To fix this,
    set the host explicitly in inputs.conf, and use a distinct copy
    of the input script for each server that you want to poll.

  - Remote monitoring of agent status may need sudo to work correctly.
    TBD - Identify whether this can be made to work without elevated
    privileges. These connections may also trigger OSSEC alerts.

  - No testing has been done for installations using agentless monitoring.


Saved Searches:

  - Several searches show errors under Splunk 4.0.6. This may be a Splunk
    problem. If you encounter problems, try upgrading to 4.0.7 or higher.
