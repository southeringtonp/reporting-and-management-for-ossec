Version 1.1
---------------------------------------

- Splunk 4.1.x is now required.

- Splunk for OSSEC is now runnable directly as an app, rather
  than just as a plugin for Search. This is now the preferred
  approach.

- New functionality added to check file hashes against the
  Team Cymru Malware Hash Registry. This can be configured
  to act as a schedueld alert.

- New functionality added to allow limited management of agents
  directly through the Splunk server. By default, access is
  restricted to Splunk admins and those with the OSSEC Admin role.

- The 'host' field now contains the OSSEC Agent machine's name
  by default. See the samples/ directory for information on
  restoring the old behaviour.

- Polling of agent status is now handled by a single script
  driven by ossec_servers.conf, rather than requiring a separate
  shell script for each OSSEC server.

- Various performance improvements.

- CSS Layout improvements.

- Summary indexing is now enabled.

- Automatic lookup table regeneration now uses summary data.

- Use of 'action' field is deprecated in favor of 'signature'.
  For now, both fields will contain the same information.

- Default mappings from signature ID to signature group have
  been refreshed based on OSSEC 2.4.1

- The lookup table containing the list of OSSEC servers has an
  additional field to indicate whether it is "managed". This
  determines which servers are visible on the agent management
  dashboard.
