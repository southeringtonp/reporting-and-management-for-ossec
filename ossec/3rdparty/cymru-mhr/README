Integration with the Malware Hash Registry (MHR) with Splunk/OSSEC is
included with permission and is subject to their terms of usage.

The Malware Hash Registry (MHR) is free for non-commercial use ONLY.
If you wish to discuss commercial use of this service, please contact
Team Cymru for more information.

If you are planning on implementing or automating the use of this service
in any free or open software, application or host, PLEASE let us know in
advance. We would like to adequately plan for capacity and make sure that
we can handle the additional load you may generate. Please use the
WHOIS-based service for larger queries. We have had instances where large
deployments are put in place without informing us in advance, making it
difficult to maintain a stable service for the rest of the community.

Attempting to enumerate the malware registry via the public service
interface is not only impractical, it is also strictly prohibited.
Contact us if the public interface is insufficient for your needs
and we may be able to come up with alternative arrangement.
